# hvtiBoostmtree 2.0.1

## Bug Fixes

* `vimpPlot()` no longer over-supplies bar labels. The internal `graphics::text()` calls passed `rep(xvar.names, 3)` — three labels for every bar — which triggered a `'labels' truncated to length ...` warning and could mislabel bars. Labels now correspond one-to-one with the plotted bars.
* `plot.boostmtree()` now draws the optimal-iteration reference line for every class of a multiclass (Nominal/Ordinal) prediction object. The internal `abline()` calls indexed an already-scalar `Mopt` as `Mopt[q]`, yielding `NA` (and a silently missing line) for the second and later classes.

# hvtiBoostmtree 2.0.0

## Breaking Changes

* Package renamed from `boostmtree` to `hvtiBoostmtree` (internal-only fork; the original `boostmtree` name remains with the upstream CRAN package). The `boostmtree()` function and S3 methods are unchanged — usage is now `library(hvtiBoostmtree); boostmtree(...)`.
* Minimum R version bumped to 4.1.0.
* Maintainership transferred to John Ehrlinger. Original authors (Ishwaran, Pande, Kogalur) remain as authors.

## New Features

* Added `ggRandomForests`, `hvtiPlotR`, and `hvtiRutilities` as optional suggested dependencies for enhanced ggplot2-based visualization workflows.
* Added two vignettes: *Introduction to boostmtree* and *Longitudinal Data Analysis with boostmtree*.
* pkgdown documentation site fully restructured with reference index, articles, and sidebar badges.
* `BugReports` field added to DESCRIPTION pointing to GitHub Issues.

## Documentation

* Comprehensive README rewritten with full badge set, installation instructions, quick-start examples, and reference citations.
* `NEWS.md` introduced (in addition to `inst/NEWS`) for pkgdown changelog rendering.

# boostmtree 1.5.2

* Minor maintenance release: updated CI/CD workflows and pkgdown configuration.

# boostmtree 1.5.1

* Added the ability to model a nominal or ordinal longitudinal response. Package now handles continuous, binary, nominal, and ordinal longitudinal responses.

# boostmtree 1.4.1

* Added the ability to model a binary response.
* Added `vimp.boostmtree()` for variable importance estimation using out-of-bag or test data, including joint VIMP for multiple covariates.

# boostmtree 1.3.0

* Fixed `mclapply` on Windows and Debian — defaults to `lapply` on those platforms.
* In-sample cross-validation now uses only out-of-bag data.
* Variable importance (VIMP) calculated from OOB data in grow mode.
* Renamed `vimp.plot` to `vimpPlot`.
* Added `marginalPlot()` — faster alternative to `partialPlot()` providing unadjusted predicted values.

# boostmtree 1.2.1

* Fix to avoid `mclapply` on Debian, defaulting to `lapply` instead.

# boostmtree 1.2.0

* Synchronization with `randomForestSRC` (>= 1.5.0) due to changes in membership output protocols.

# boostmtree 1.1.0

* Added in-sample cross-validation for determining the optimal boosting iteration.
* Various bug fixes.

# boostmtree 1.0.0

* Initial CRAN release.

# Atrial Fibrillation Data

Atrial Fibrillation (AF) data is obtained from a randomized trial to
study the effect of surgical ablation as a treatment option for AF among
patients with persistent and long-standing persistent AF who requires
mitral valve surgery. Patients were randomized into two groups: mitral
valve surgery with ablation and mitral valve surgery without ablation.
Patients in the ablation group were further randomized into two types of
procedure: pulmonary vain isolation (PVI) and biatrial maze procedure.
These patients were followed weekly for a period of 12 months. The
primary outcome of the study is the presence/absence of AF (binary
longitudinal response). Data includes 228 patients. From 228 patients,
7949 AF measurements are available with average of 35 measurements per
patient.

## Format

A list containing four elements:

1.  The 84 patient variables (features).

2.  Time points (time).

3.  Unique patient identifier (id).

4.  Presence or absence of AF (y).

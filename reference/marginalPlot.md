# Marginal plot analysis

Marginal plot of x against the unadjusted predicted y. This is mainly
used to obtain marginal relationships between x and the unadjusted
predicted y. Marginal plots have a faster execution compared to partial
plots (Friedman, 2001).

## Usage

``` r
marginalPlot(
  object,
  xvar.names,
  tm.unq,
  subset,
  plot.it = FALSE,
  path_saveplot = NULL,
  Verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  A boosting object of class `(boostmtree, grow)`.

- xvar.names:

  Names of the x-variables to be used. By default, all variables are
  plotted.

- tm.unq:

  Unique time points used for the plots of x against y. By default, the
  deciles of the observed time values are used.

- subset:

  Vector indicating which rows of the x-data to be used for the
  analysis. The default is to use the entire data.

- plot.it:

  Should plots be displayed? If `xvar.names` is a vector with more than
  one variable name, then instead of displaying, plot is stored as
  "MarginalPlot.pdf" in the location specified by `path_saveplot`.

- path_saveplot:

  Provide the location where plot should be saved. By default the plot
  will be saved at temporary folder.

- Verbose:

  Display the path where the plot is saved?

- ...:

  Further arguments passed to or from other methods.

## Value

Invisibly returns a list with components `p.obj` (marginal effect
estimates), `l.obj` (lowess smoothed longitudinal estimates, or `NULL`
if `plot.it = FALSE`), and `time` (time points used for evaluation).

## Details

Marginal plot of x values specified by `xvar.names` against the
unadjusted predicted y-values over a set of time points specified by
`tm.unq`. Analysis can be restricted to a subset of the data using
`subset`.

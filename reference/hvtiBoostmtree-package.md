# Boosted multivariate trees for longitudinal data.

Multivariate extension of Friedman's (2001) gradient descent boosting
method for modeling longitudinal response using multivariate tree base
learners. Longitudinal response could be continuous, binary, nominal or
ordinal. Covariate-time interactions are modeled using penalized
B-splines (P-splines) with estimated adaptive smoothing parameter.

## Package Overview

This package contains many useful functions and users should read the
help file in its entirety for details. However, we briefly mention
several key functions that may make it easier to navigate and understand
the layout of the package.

1.  [`boostmtree`](https://ehrlinger.github.io/hvtiBoostmtree/reference/boostmtree.md)

    This is the main entry point to the package. It grows a multivariate
    tree using user supplied training data. Trees are grown using the
    randomForestSRC R-package.

2.  [`predict.boostmtree`](https://ehrlinger.github.io/hvtiBoostmtree/reference/predict.boostmtree.md)
    (`predict`)

    Used for prediction. Predicted values are obtained by dropping the
    user supplied test data down the grow forest. The resulting object
    has class `(rfsrc, predict)`.

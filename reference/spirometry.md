# Spirometry Data

Data consists of 9471 longitudinal evaluations of forced 1-second
expiratory volume (FEV1-percentage of predicted) after lung transplant
from 509 patients who underwent lung transplant (LTx) at the Cleveland
Clinic. Twenty three patient/procedure variables were collected at the
time of the transplant. The major objectives are to evaluate the
temporal trend of FEV1 after LTx, and to identify factors associated
with post-LTx FEV1 and assessing the differences in the trends after
Single LTx versus Double LTx.

## Format

A list containing four elements:

1.  The 23 patient variables (features).

2.  Time points (time).

3.  Unique patient identifier (id).

4.  FEV1-outcomes (y).

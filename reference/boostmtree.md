# Boosted multivariate trees for longitudinal data

Multivariate extension of Friedman's gradient descent boosting method
for modeling continuous or binary longitudinal response using
multivariate tree base learners (Pande et al., 2017). Covariate-time
interactions are modeled using penalized B-splines (P-splines) with
estimated adaptive smoothing parameter.

## Usage

``` r
boostmtree(
  x,
  tm,
  id,
  y,
  family = c("Continuous", "Binary", "Nominal", "Ordinal"),
  y_reference = NULL,
  M = 200,
  nu = 0.05,
  na.action = c("na.omit", "na.impute")[2],
  K = 5,
  mtry = NULL,
  nknots = 10,
  d = 3,
  pen.ord = 3,
  lambda,
  rho,
  lambda.max = 1e+06,
  lambda.iter = 2,
  svd.tol = 1e-06,
  forest.tol = 0.001,
  verbose = TRUE,
  cv.flag = FALSE,
  eps = 1e-05,
  mod.grad = TRUE,
  NR.iter = 3,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  Data frame (or matrix) containing the x-values. Rows must be
  duplicated to match the number of time points for an individual. That
  is, if individual *i* has *n\[i\]* outcome y-values, then there must
  be *n\[i\]* duplicate rows of *i*'s x-value.

- tm:

  Vector of time values, one entry for each row in `x`.

- id:

  Unique subject identifier, one entry for each row in `x`.

- y:

  Observed y-value, one entry for each row in `x`.

- family:

  Family of the response variable `y`. Use any one from `"Continuous"`,
  `"Binary"`, `"Nominal"`, or `"Ordinal"` based on the scale of `y`.

- y_reference:

  Set this value, among the unique `y` values when `family` ==
  "Nominal". If NULL, lowest value, among unique `y` values, is used.

- M:

  Number of boosting iterations. Must be a positive integer.

- nu:

  Boosting regularization (shrinkage) parameter. Must be positive;
  typical values are 0.01–0.1. Smaller values require larger `M`.

- na.action:

  Remove missing values (casewise) or impute them. Default is to impute
  the missing values.

- K:

  Number of terminal nodes used for the multivariate tree learner. Must
  be a positive integer; typical values are 3–10.

- mtry:

  Number of `x` variables selected randomly for tree fitting. Default is
  use all `x` variables.

- nknots:

  Number of knots used for the B-spline for modeling the time
  interaction effect.

- d:

  Degree of the piecewise B-spline polynomial (no time effect is fit
  when d \< 1).

- pen.ord:

  Differencing order used to define the penalty with increasing values
  implying greater smoothness.

- lambda:

  Smoothing (penalty) parameter used for B-splines with increasing
  values associated with increasing smoothness/penalization. If missing,
  or non-positive, the value is estimated adaptively using a mixed
  models approach.

- rho:

  If missing, rho is estimated, else, use the `rho` value specified in
  this argument.

- lambda.max:

  Tolerance used for adaptively estimated lambda (caps it). For experts
  only.

- lambda.iter:

  Number of iterations used to estimate lambda (only applies when lambda
  is not supplied and adaptive smoothing is employed).

- svd.tol:

  Tolerance value used in the SVD calculation of the penalty matrix. For
  experts only.

- forest.tol:

  Tolerance used for forest weighted least squares solution.
  Experimental and for experts only.

- verbose:

  Should verbose output be printed?

- cv.flag:

  Should in-sample cross-validation (CV) be used to determine optimal
  stopping using out of bag data?

- eps:

  Tolerance value used for determining the optimal `M`. Applies only if
  `cv.flag` = TRUE. For experts only.

- mod.grad:

  Use a modified gradient? See details below.

- NR.iter:

  Number of Newton-Raphson iteration. Applied for `family` = `"Binary"`,
  `"Nominal"`, or `"Ordinal"`.

  Further arguments passed to or from other methods.

## Value

An object of class `(boostmtree, grow)` with the following components:

  response in list-format where each element coverted the response into
  the binary response.

- family:

  Family of `y`.

- ymean:

  Overall mean of y-values for all individuals. If `family` = "Binary",
  `ymean` = 0.

- ysd:

  Overall standard deviation of y-values for all individuals. If
  `family` = "Binary", `ysd` = 1.

- na.action:

  Remove missing values or impute?

  family == "Nominal" or family == "Ordinal", `mu` will have a higher
  level of list to accommodate binary responses generated from nominal
  or ordinal response.

  Forest tolerance value (needed for prediction).

## Details

Each individual has observed y-values, over possibly different time
points, with possibly differing number of time points. Given y, the time
points, and x, the conditional mean time profile of y is estimated using
gradient boosting in which the gradient is derived from a criterion
function involving a working variance matrix for y specified as an
equicorrelation matrix with parameter *rho* multiplied by a variance
parameter *phi*. Multivariate trees are used for base learners and
weighted least squares is used for solving the terminal node
optimization problem. This provides solutions to the core parameters of
the algorithm. For ancillary parameters, a mixed-model formulation is
used to estimate the smoothing parameter associated with the B-splines
used for the time-interaction effect, although the user can manually set
the smoothing parameter as well. Ancillary parameters *rho* and *phi*
are estimated using GLS (generalized least squares).

In the original boostmtree algorithm (Pande et al., 2017), the
equicorrelation parameter *rho* is used in two places in the algorithm:
(1) for growing trees using the gradient, which depends upon *rho*; and
(2) for solving the terminal node optimization problem which also uses
the gradient. However, Pande (2017) observed that setting *rho* to zero
in the gradient used for growing trees improved performance of the
algorithm, especially in high dimensions. For this reason the default
setting used in this algorithm is to set *rho* to zero in the gradient
for (1). The `rho` in the gradient for (2) is not touched. The option
`mod.grad` specifies whether a modified gradient is used in the tree
growing process and is TRUE by default.

By default, trees are grown from a bootstrap sample of the data – thus
the boosting method employed here is a modified example of stochastic
gradient descent boosting (Friedman, 2002). Stochastic descent often
improves performance and has the added advantage that out-of-sample data
(out-of-bag, OOB) can be used to calculate variable importance (VIMP).

The package implements R-side parallel processing by replacing the R
function `lapply` with `mclapply` found in the parallel package. You can
set the number of cores accessed by `mclapply` by issuing the command
`options(mc.cores = x)`, where `x` is the number of cores. The options
command can also be placed in the users .Rprofile file for convenience.
You can, alternatively, initialize the environment variable `MC_CORES`
in your shell environment.

As an example, issuing the following options command uses all available
cores for R-side parallel processing:

`options(mc.cores=detectCores())`

However, be cautious when setting `mc.cores`. This can create not only
high CPU usage but also high RAM usage, especially when using functions
`partialPlot` and `predict`.

The method can impute the missing observations in x (covariates) using
on the fly imputation. Details regarding can be found in the
randomForestSRC package. If missing values are present in the `tm`, `id`
or `y`, the user should either impute or delete these values before
executing the function.

Finally note `cv.flag` can be used for an in-sample cross-validated
estimate of prediction error. This is used to determine the optimized
number of boosting iterations *Mopt*. The final mu predictor is
evaluated at this value and is cross-validated. The prediction error
returned via `err.rate` is standardized by the overall standard
deviation of y.
